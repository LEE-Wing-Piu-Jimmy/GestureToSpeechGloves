Catch the signal of a start -> start collecting the whole sequence of gestures -> catch the signal of the end -> stop collecting -> break the sequence into seperate gestures -> classify all of them -> form a meaningful understandable sentence

Details:
The first AI : The signal is just a gesture, so we use our gesture classifier to catch the signal.
The second AI: The chunkation of gestures is done by spotting the empty space between them, in other words evaluating the variance.
The third AI: form the sentence by combining the parts

The first AI: KNN with DTW as distance calculation function
    fit all the (6D) data and label to the model
    classify by comparing to each result, take the lowest K cost result and take the label

    Problem:
        each label correspond to a 6 values vector



Skills:
    'self' (similar to 'this')

    The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

    It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class
